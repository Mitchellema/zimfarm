## What is ZimFarm?

ZimFarm is an open-source web application to connect farmers directly to
consumers.

It allows consumers to create shopping lists of needed food items and
then, using ZimFarm, consumers can view lists of nearby farmers who are
growing those crops and then purchase those items directly from the
farmers using the ZimFarm payment system and even arrange for delivery
directly to their door!
